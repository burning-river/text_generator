# Keywords-to-text Generator
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the keywords-to-text generator web app. In this application, still under development, we help users by generating syntactically correct text from keywords. In the current version of the app, users can input 2-5 keywords to generate conversational style text. The app isn't currently well suited to generate longer sentences. This issue will be addressed in the future.
